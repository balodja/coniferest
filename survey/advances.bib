  abstract = {Ensemble analysis has recently been studied in the context of the outlier detection problem. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical underpinnings of outlier ensemble analysis. In spite of the significant differences between the classification and the outlier analysis problems, we show that the theoretical underpinnings between the two problems are actually quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off. We explain the existing algorithms within this traditional framework, and clarify misconceptions about the reasoning underpinning these methods. We propose more effective variants of subsampling and feature bagging. We also discuss the impact of the combination function and discuss the specific trade-offs of the average and maximization functions. We use these insights to propose new combination functions that are robust in many settings.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant challenge in data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms search for outliers and then predict that these outliers are the anomalies. When deployed, however, these algorithms are often criticized for high false positive and high false negative rates. One cause of poor performance is that not all outliers are anomalies and not all anomalies are outliers. In this paper, we describe an Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) method for incorporating expert feedback to adjust the anomaly detector so that the outliers it discovers are more in tune with the expert user’s semantic understanding of the anomalies. The AAD approach is designed to operate in an interactive data exploration loop. In each iteration of this loop, our algorithm first selects a data instance to present to the expert as a potential anomaly and then the expert labels the instance as an anomaly or as a nominal data point. Our algorithm updates its internal model with the instance label and the loop continues until a budget of B queries is spent. The goal of our approach is to maximize the total number of true anomalies in the B instances presented to the expert. We show that when compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, AAD is consistently one of the best performers.},

In this paper, we attempt to discover insider threat by identifying abnormal behavior in enterprise social and online activity data of employees. To this end, we process and extract relevant features that are possibly indicative of insider threat behavior. This includes features extracted from social data including email communication patterns and content, and online activity data such as web browsing patterns, email frequency, and file and machine access patterns. Subsequently, we detect statistically abnormal behavior with respect to these features using state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, and declare this abnormal behavior as a proxy for insider threat activity. We test our approach on a real world data set with artificially injected insider threat events. We obtain a ROC score of 0.77, which shows that our proposed approach is fairly successful in identifying insider threat events. Finally, we build a visualization dashboard that enables managers and HR personnel to quickly identify employees with high threat risk scores which will enable them to take suitable preventive measures and limit security risk.},

  abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.},

Unfortunately, many of anomaly detection schemes are still imperfect i.e., they are not effective enough or act in a non-intuitive way or they are focused on a specific type of data. In this study, the classical method of Isolation Forest is thoroughly analyzed and augmented by bringing an innovative approach. This is k-Means-Based Isolation Forest that allows to build a search tree based on many branches in contrast to the only two considered in the original method. k-Means clustering is used to predict the number of divisions on each decision tree node. As supported through experimental studies, the proposed method works effectively for data coming from various application areas including intermodal transport and geographical, spatio-temporal data. In addition, it enables a user to intuitively determine the anomaly score for an individual record of the analyzed dataset. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is able to fit the data at the step of decision tree building. Moreover, it returns more intuitively appealing anomaly score values.},

In order to provide appropriate real-time assistive services to these elders, such as reminders and alerts, we propose a disorientation detection method that detects outliers in one’s GPS trajectories. In particular, we first model an individual’s movement trajectories as a graph based on her historical GPS traces. We then identify outlying trajectories that have a defined wandering or deviating pattern as potential instances of disorientation. We develop a method called iBDD that is able to detect two categories of outlying trajectories in a uniform framework in real-time. Using ten individuals’ real-world GPS datasets, we demonstrate that iBDD can achieve 95\% detection rate of disorientation with less than 3\% of false positives, based on properly chosen parameters.},

Distance-based and density-based methods are inherently restricted by their basic assumptions—anomalies are either far from normal points or being sparse. Clustered anomalies are able to avoid detection since they defy these assumptions by being dense and, in many cases, in close proximity to normal instances. In this paper, without using any density or distance measure, we propose a new method called SCiForest to detect clustered anomalies. SCiForest separates clustered anomalies from normal points effectively even when clustered anomalies are very close to normal points. It maintains the ability of existing methods to detect scattered anomalies, and it has superior time and space complexities against existing distance-based and density-based methods.},

The common approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternative approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. The proposed method employs completely-random trees which have been shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning independently in the literature. The completely-random trees are used as a single common core to solve all three subproblems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and model update on data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing classification-focused methods.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detectors are often used to produce a ranked list of statistical anomalies, which are examined by human analysts in order to extract the actual anomalies of interest. This can be exceedingly difficult and time consuming when most high-ranking anomalies are false positives and not interesting from an application perspective. In this paper, we study how to reduce the analyst's effort by incorporating their feedback about whether the anomalies they investigate are of interest or not. In particular, the feedback will be used to adjust the anomaly ranking after every analyst interaction, ideally moving anomalies of interest closer to the top. Our main contribution is to formulate this problem within the framework of online convex optimization, which yields an efficient and extremely simple approach to incorporating feedback compared to the prior state-of-the-art. We instantiate this approach for the powerful class of tree-based anomaly detectors and conduct experiments on a range of benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the utility of incorporating feedback and advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we present results on a significant cybersecurity application where the goal is to detect red-team attacks in real system audit data. We show that our approach for incorporating feedback is able to significantly reduce the time required to identify malicious system entities across multiple attacks on multiple operating systems.},

  abstract = {Anomalous user behavior detection is the core component of many information security systems, such as intrusion detection, insider threat detection and authentication systems. Anomalous behavior will raise an alarm to the system administrator and can be further combined with other information to determine whether it constitutes an unauthorised or malicious use of a resource. This paper presents an anomalous user behaviour detection framework that applies an extended version of Isolation Forest algorithm. Our method is fast and scalable and does not require example anomalies in the training data set. We apply our method to an enterprise dataset. The experimental results show that the system is able to isolate anomalous instances from the baseline user model using a single feature or combined features.},

  abstract = {The problem of finding anomalies and outliers in datasets is one of the most important challenges of modern data analysis. Among the commonly dedicated tools to solve this task one can find Isolation Forest (IF) that is an efficient, conceptually simple, and fast method. In this study, we propose the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) that is an intuitively appealing and efficient enhancement of the original approach. The proposed generalization is based on nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment. Introduction of the generalization allows to achieve more effective splits that are rather performed between the clusters, i.e. regions where datapoints constitute dense formations and not through them. In a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that the proposed method allows us to detect anomalies hidden between clusters more effectively. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our approach favorably affects the quality of anomaly detection in both artificial and real datasets. In terms of time complexity our method is close to the original one since the generalization is related only to the building of the trees while the scoring procedure (which takes the main time) is kept unchanged.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of outlying aspects mining: given a query object and a reference multidimensional data set, how can we discover what aspects (i.e., subsets of features or subspaces) make the query object most outlying? Outlying aspects mining can be used to explain any data point of interest, which itself might be an inlier or outlier. In this paper, we investigate several open challenges faced by existing outlying aspects mining techniques and propose novel solutions, including (a) how to design effective scoring functions that are unbiased with respect to dimensionality and yet being computationally efficient, and (b) how to efficiently search through the exponentially large search space of all possible subspaces. We formalize the concept of dimensionality unbiasedness, a desirable property of outlyingness measures. We then characterize existing scoring measures as well as our novel proposed ones in terms of efficiency, dimensionality unbiasedness and interpretability. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of different methods for outlying aspects discovery and demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach on both large real and synthetic data sets.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection in streaming data is of high interest in numerous application domains. In this paper, we propose a novel one-class semi-supervised algorithm to detect anomalies in streaming data. Underlying the algorithm is a fast and accurate density estimator implemented by multiple fully randomized space trees (RS-Trees), named RS-Forest. The piecewise constant density estimate of each RS-tree is defined on the tree node into which an instance falls. Each incoming instance in a data stream is scored by the density estimates averaged over all trees in the forest. Two strategies, statistical attribute range estimation of high probability guarantee and dual node profiles for rapid model update, are seamlessly integrated into RS Forestto systematically address the ever-evolving nature of data streams. We derive the theoretical upper bound for the proposed algorithm and analyze its asymptotic properties via bias-variance decomposition. Empirical comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method features high detection rate, fast response, and insensitivity to most of the parameter settings. Algorithm implementations and datasets are available upon request.},

In this paper, we aim to discover anomalous driving patterns from taxi’s GPS traces, targeting applications like automatically detecting taxi driving frauds or road network change in modern cites. To achieve the objective, firstly we group all the taxi trajectories crossing the same sourcedestination cell-pair and represent each taxi trajectory as a sequence of symbols. Secondly, we propose an IsolationBased Anomalous Trajectory (iBAT) detection method and verify with large scale taxi data that iBAT achieves remarkable performance (AUC{$>$}0.99, over 90\% detection rate at false alarm rate of less than 2\%). Finally, we demonstrate the potential of iBAT in enabling innovative applications by using it for taxi driving fraud detection and road network change detection.},

In contrast to deep neural networks which require great effort in hyper-parameter tuning, gcForest is much easier to train; even when it is applied to different data across different domains in our experiments, excellent performance can be achieved by almost same settings of hyper-parameters. The training process of gcForest is efficient, and users can control training cost according to computational resource available. The efficiency may be further enhanced because gcForest is naturally apt to parallel implementation. Furthermore, in contrast to deep neural networks which require largescale training data, gcForest can work well even when there are only small-scale training data.},

  abstract = {Ensemble analysis has recently been studied in the context of the outlier detection problem. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical underpinnings of outlier ensemble analysis. In spite of the significant differences between the classification and the outlier analysis problems, we show that the theoretical underpinnings between the two problems are actually quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off. We explain the existing algorithms within this traditional framework, and clarify misconceptions about the reasoning underpinning these methods. We propose more effective variants of subsampling and feature bagging. We also discuss the impact of the combination function and discuss the specific trade-offs of the average and maximization functions. We use these insights to propose new combination functions that are robust in many settings.},

While it is effective in detecting global anomalies, it fails to detect local anomalies in data sets having multiple clusters of normal instances because the local anomalies are masked by normal clusters of similar density and they become less susceptible to isolation. In this paper, we propose a very simple but effective solution to overcome this limitation by replacing the global ranking measure based on path length with a local ranking measure based on relative mass that takes local data distribution into consideration. We demonstrate the utility of relative mass by improving the task specific performance of iForest in anomaly detection and information retrieval tasks.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant challenge in data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results.},

  abstract = {Mineral exploration targets can be delineated through multivariate analysis. These targets are usually recognized as anomalies in the procedure of data mining using a detection algorithm. In this paper, isolation forest, which is a data-mining algorithm for anomaly detection, was adapted to map gold prospectivity in the Laotudingzi–Xiaosiping district in Jilin Province, northeastern China. The performance of the isolation forest model was compared with those of restricted Boltzmann machine and logistic regression models for mapping gold prospectivity. The isolation forest model outperforms the restricted Boltzmann machine model but not the logistic regression model based on the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve; however, the isolation forest model is much more efficient than the other two models in terms of data-processing efficiency. It takes 15.48, 254.74, and 57.33~s, respectively, to integrate the predictor map layers using the three models. Gold mineral exploration targets were optimally delineated by using the Youden index to maximize spatial association between delineated gold mineral exploration targets and the discovered gold deposits. Gold mineral exploration targets predicted by the three models occupy 10.97, 10.36, and 8.40\% of the study area and contain 88, 81, and 81\% of the discovered gold deposits. Therefore, the isolation forest algorithm is a potentially useful mineral prospectivity mapping method.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms search for outliers and then predict that these outliers are the anomalies. When deployed, however, these algorithms are often criticized for high false positive and high false negative rates. One cause of poor performance is that not all outliers are anomalies and not all anomalies are outliers. In this paper, we describe an Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) method for incorporating expert feedback to adjust the anomaly detector so that the outliers it discovers are more in tune with the expert user’s semantic understanding of the anomalies. The AAD approach is designed to operate in an interactive data exploration loop. In each iteration of this loop, our algorithm first selects a data instance to present to the expert as a potential anomaly and then the expert labels the instance as an anomaly or as a nominal data point. Our algorithm updates its internal model with the instance label and the loop continues until a budget of B queries is spent. The goal of our approach is to maximize the total number of true anomalies in the B instances presented to the expert. We show that when compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, AAD is consistently one of the best performers.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detectors are often used to produce a ranked list of statistical anomalies, which are examined by human analysts in order to extract the actual anomalies of interest. Unfortunately, in realworld applications, this process can be exceedingly difficult for the analyst since a large fraction of high-ranking anomalies are false positives and not interesting from the application perspective. In this paper, we aim to make the analyst's job easier by allowing for analyst feedback during the investigation process. Ideally, the feedback influences the ranking of the anomaly detector in a way that reduces the number of false positives that must be examined before discovering the anomalies of interest. In particular, we introduce a novel technique for incorporating simple binary feedback into tree-based anomaly detectors. We focus on the Isolation Forest algorithm as a representative tree-based anomaly detector, and show that we can significantly improve its performance by incorporating feedback, when compared with the baseline algorithm that does not incorporate feedback. Our technique is simple and scales well as the size of the data increases, which makes it suitable for interactive discovery of anomalies in large datasets.},

Subsequently, we detect statistically abnormal behavior with respect to these features using state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, and declare this abnormal behavior as a proxy for insider threat activity. We test our approach on a real world data set with artificially injected insider threat events. We obtain a ROC score of 0.77, which shows that our proposed approach is fairly successful in identifying insider threat events.

What is the best way to convince a human analyst that the point is indeed an outlier? We provide succinct, interpretable, and simple pictorial explanations of outlying behavior in multi-dimensional real-valued datasets while respecting the limited attention of human analysts. Specifically, we propose to output a few focus-plots, i.e., pairwise feature plots, from a few, carefully chosen feature sub-spaces. The proposed LookOut makes four contributions: (a) problem formulation: we introduce an “analyst-centered” problem formulation for explaining outliers via focus-plots, (b) explanation algorithm: we propose a plot-selection objective and the LookOut algorithm to approximate it with optimality guarantees, (c) generality: our explanation algorithm is both domain- and detector-agnostic, and (d) scalability: LookOut scales linearly with the size of input outliers to explain and the explanation budget. Our experiments show that LookOut performs near-ideally in terms of maximizing explanation objective on several real datasets, while producing visually interpretable and intuitive results in explaining groundtruth outliers.

  abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.},

Predictor functions are almost always learned on a set of highly correlated data comprising a very small segment of predictor space. Moreover, flexible predictors, by their very nature, are not controlled at points of extrapolation. This becomes a problem for diagnostic tools that require evaluation on a product distribution. It is also an issue when we are trying to optimize a response over some variable in the input space. Finally, it can be a problem in non-static systems in which the underlying predictor distribution gradually drifts with time or when typographical errors misrecord the values of some predictors.},

Unfortunately, many of anomaly detection schemes are still imperfect i.e., they are not effective enough or act in a non-intuitive way or they are focused on a specific type of data. In this study, the classical method of Isolation Forest is thoroughly analyzed and augmented by bringing an innovative approach. This is k-Means-Based Isolation Forest that allows to build a search tree based on many branches in contrast to the only two considered in the original method. k-Means clustering is used to predict the number of divisions on each decision tree node. As supported through experimental studies, the proposed method works effectively for data coming from various application areas including intermodal transport and geographical, spatio-temporal data. In addition, it enables a user to intuitively determine the anomaly score for an individual record of the analyzed dataset. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is able to fit the data at the step of decision tree building. Moreover, it returns more intuitively appealing anomaly score values.},

In order to provide appropriate real-time assistive services to these elders, such as reminders and alerts, we propose a disorientation detection method that detects outliers in one’s GPS trajectories. In particular, we first model an individual’s movement trajectories as a graph based on her historical GPS traces. We then identify outlying trajectories that have a defined wandering or deviating pattern as potential instances of disorientation. We develop a method called iBDD that is able to detect two categories of outlying trajectories in a uniform framework in real-time. Using ten individuals’ real-world GPS datasets, we demonstrate that iBDD can achieve 95\% detection rate of disorientation with less than 3\% of false positives, based on properly chosen parameters.},

Distance-based and density-based methods are inherently restricted by their basic assumptions—anomalies are either far from normal points or being sparse. Clustered anomalies are able to avoid detection since they defy these assumptions by being dense and, in many cases, in close proximity to normal instances. In this paper, without using any density or distance measure, we propose a new method called SCiForest to detect clustered anomalies. SCiForest separates clustered anomalies from normal points effectively even when clustered anomalies are very close to normal points. It maintains the ability of existing methods to detect scattered anomalies, and it has superior time and space complexities against existing distance-based and density-based methods.},

The common approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternative approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. The proposed method employs completely-random trees which have been shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning independently in the literature. The completely-random trees are used as a single common core to solve all three subproblems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and model update on data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing classification-focused methods.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detectors are often used to produce a ranked list of statistical anomalies, which are examined by human analysts in order to extract the actual anomalies of interest. This can be exceedingly difficult and time consuming when most high-ranking anomalies are false positives and not interesting from an application perspective. In this paper, we study how to reduce the analyst's effort by incorporating their feedback about whether the anomalies they investigate are of interest or not. In particular, the feedback will be used to adjust the anomaly ranking after every analyst interaction, ideally moving anomalies of interest closer to the top. Our main contribution is to formulate this problem within the framework of online convex optimization, which yields an efficient and extremely simple approach to incorporating feedback compared to the prior state-of-the-art. We instantiate this approach for the powerful class of tree-based anomaly detectors and conduct experiments on a range of benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the utility of incorporating feedback and advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we present results on a significant cybersecurity application where the goal is to detect red-team attacks in real system audit data. We show that our approach for incorporating feedback is able to significantly reduce the time required to identify malicious system entities across multiple attacks on multiple operating systems.},

Although there are many methods around for network traffic anomaly detection, they are all designed for single machine, failing to deal with the case that the network traffic data are so large that it is prohibitive for a single computer to store and process the data. To solve these problems, we propose a parallel algorithm based on Isolation Forest and Spark for network traffic anomaly detection. We combine the advantages of Isolation Forest algorithm in network traffic anomaly detection and big data processing capability of Spark technology. Meanwhile, we apply the idea of parallelization to the process of modeling and evaluation. In the calculation process, by assigning tasks to multiple compute nodes, Isolation Forest and Spark can efficiently perform anomaly detection and evaluation process. By this way, we can also solve the problem of computation bottleneck on single machine. Extensive experiments on real world datasets show that our Isolation Forest and Spark is efficient and scales well for anomaly detection on large network traffic data.},

In this study, we propose the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) that is an intuitively appealing and efficient enhancement of the original approach. The proposed generalization is based on nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment. Introduction of the generalization allows to achieve more effective splits that are rather performed between the clusters, i.e. regions where datapoints constitute dense formations and not through them. In a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that the proposed method allows us to detect anomalies hidden between clusters more effectively. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our approach favorably affects the quality of anomaly detection in both artificial and real datasets. In terms of time complexity our method is close to the original one since the generalization is related only to the building of the trees while the scoring procedure (which takes the main time) is kept unchanged.},

The subsets of probability distributions are defined by using Walley’s imprecise pari-mutuel model which compactly divides the unit simplex of probabilities into subsets and allows us to simplify the algorithm of the weight calculation.

In this paper, we propose a novel one-class semi-supervised algorithm to detect anomalies in streaming data. Underlying the algorithm is a fast and accurate density estimator implemented by multiple fully randomized space trees (RS-Trees), named RS-Forest. The piecewise constant density estimate of each RS-tree is defined on the tree node into which an instance falls. Each incoming instance in a data stream is scored by the density estimates averaged over all trees in the forest. Two strategies, statistical attribute range estimation of high probability guarantee and dual node profiles for rapid model update, are seamlessly integrated into RS Forestto systematically address the ever-evolving nature of data streams. We derive the theoretical upper bound for the proposed algorithm and analyze its asymptotic properties via bias-variance decomposition. Empirical comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method features high detection rate, fast response, and insensitivity to most of the parameter settings.

Instead of analyzing normal instances, our algorithm first employs an efficient deterministic space partition algorithm to eliminate obvious normal instances and generates a small set of anomaly candidates with a single scan of the dataset. It then checks each candidate with density-based multiple criteria to determine the final results. This two-stage framework also detects anomalies of different notions. Our experiments show that this new approach finds anomalies successfully in different conditions and ensures a good balance of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.},

  abstract = {GPS-equipped taxis can be viewed as pervasive sensors and the large-scale digital traces produced allow us to reveal many hidden “facts” about the city dynamics and human behaviors. In this paper, we aim to discover anomalous driving patterns from taxi’s GPS traces, targeting applications like automatically detecting taxi driving frauds or road network change in modern cites. To achieve the objective, firstly we group all the taxi trajectories crossing the same sourcedestination cell-pair and represent each taxi trajectory as a sequence of symbols. Secondly, we propose an IsolationBased Anomalous Trajectory (iBAT) detection method and verify with large scale taxi data that iBAT achieves remarkable performance (AUC{$>$}0.99, over 90\% detection rate at false alarm rate of less than 2\%). Finally, we demonstrate the potential of iBAT in enabling innovative applications by using it for taxi driving fraud detection and road network change detection.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose gcForest, a decision tree ensemble approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks in a broad range of tasks. In contrast to deep neural networks which require great effort in hyper-parameter tuning, gcForest is much easier to train; even when it is applied to different data across different domains in our experiments, excellent performance can be achieved by almost same settings of hyper-parameters. The training process of gcForest is efficient, and users can control training cost according to computational resource available. The efficiency may be further enhanced because gcForest is naturally apt to parallel implementation. Furthermore, in contrast to deep neural networks which require largescale training data, gcForest can work well even when there are only small-scale training data.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel ranking framework for content-based multimedia information retrieval (CBMIR). The framework introduces relevance features and a new ranking scheme. Each relevance feature measures the relevance of an instance with respect to a profile of the targeted multimedia database. We show that the task of CBMIR can be done more effectively using the relevance features than the original features. Furthermore, additional performance gain is achieved by incorporating our new ranking scheme which modifies instance rankings based on the weighted average of relevance feature values. Experiments on image and music databases validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Anomalies are data points that are few and different. As a result of these properties, we show that, anomalies are susceptible to a mechanism called               isolation               . This article proposes a method called Isolation Forest (               i               Forest), which detects anomalies purely based on the concept of isolation without employing any distance or density measure---fundamentally different from all existing methods.                                         As a result,               i               Forest is able to exploit subsampling (i) to achieve a low linear time-complexity and a small memory-requirement and (ii) to deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively. Our empirical evaluation shows that               i               Forest outperforms ORCA, one-class SVM, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC, processing time, and it is robust against masking and swamping effects.               i               Forest also works well in high dimensional problems containing a large number of irrelevant attributes, and when anomalies are not available in training sample.},

  abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},
